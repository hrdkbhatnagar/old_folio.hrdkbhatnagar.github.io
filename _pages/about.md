Hi! My name is Hardik, and I am a graduate of BITS Pilani, India, where I pursued a double major in (B.E.) Computer Science and (M.Sc.) Biological Sciences.

My passion lies at the intersection of neuroscience and computer science, specifically in applyng deep learning, vision science and language modelling. 

Currently I am a research intern at Microsoft Research, India, where I am working with [Dr. Navin Goyal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=w8WJCnkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) on reverse engineering and explaining the internal representations of language and vision models with mechanistic interpretability.

For the past year, I was a research engineer at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics (University of Tübingen), Germany, under [Prof. Andreas Bartels](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xHA9heEAAAAJ&hl=en). I uncovered the role of high-level and low-level image features and their link with neural activity with deep learning modelling. 

I pursued my master's thesis at the Allen Institute for Brain Science, Seattle under [Prof. Kaspar Podgorski](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AKKUvgEAAAAJ&hl=en). My research invoved simulating a single neuron as a deep learning model to infer its input-output computations with partial observability of its inputs and outputs.

During my bachelor's thesis at EPFL, Switzerland under [Prof. Johan Auwerx](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Kf5YXGYAAAAJ&hl=en), I investigated mitochondrial dysfunction associated with aging by modelling timeseries metabolic data with machine learning, and devising a health index for human age related deterioration.



<!-- NMA TAs -->

<!-- I most recently parcipated at the [Neuromatch Academy](https://www.neuromatchacademy.org/), a summer school on computational neuroscience. I worked on various computational tools and their applications for real-world neuroscience problems. 
I also worked on the [Human Connectome Project (HCP)](https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/data-releases) dataset to analyze neural patterns in face and shape recognition in the human brain.

I previously worked at the [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/a/?lidx=1) as a research intern analyzing protein engineering techniques using machine learning tools. Specifically, I explored directed evolution, a method of selection based on natural evolution to filter specific biophysical properties of the proteins. -->
