<!-- Hi! I am Hardik, I pursued double majors in (B.E.) Computer Science and (M.Sc.) Biological Sciences from [BITS Pilani, India](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/){:target="\_blank"}. -->

Hi! My name is Hardik, and I am a graduate of BITS Pilani, India, where I pursued a double major in (B.E.) Computer Science and (M.Sc.) Biological Sciences.

My passion lies at the intersection of biology and computer science, specifically in machine learning, deep learning, computational neuroscience, and computational biology.

<!-- My research interest lies at the intersection of biology and computer science. I'm exploring machine learning, deep learning, computational neuroscience, computational biology and bioinformatics.  -->

<!-- RAship in Tuebingen -->
<!-- I'm currently working as a research assistant at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/) under Prof. Andreas Bartels in the Vision and Cognition lab. I'm trying to link visual saliency of stimuli with modulations along the visual processing hierarchy with the help of deep learning.  -->

Currently, I am working as a research assistant at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/) in the Vision and Cognition lab under the supervision of Prof. Andreas Bartels. My research focuses on using deep learning to link visual saliency of stimuli with modulations along the visual processing hierarchy.



<!-- Thesis at Allen -->
<!-- Prior to that, I pursed my master's thesis at the [Allen Institute for Brain Science](https://alleninstitute.org/), Seattle under Prof. Kaspar Podgorski where I worked on inferring neuronal computations from partially observing its inputs and outputs.  -->
Prior to this, I pursued my master's thesis at the [Allen Institute for Brain Science](https://alleninstitute.org/) in Seattle under Prof. Kaspar Podgorski. My research involved inferring neuronal computations by partially observing their inputs and outputs.


<!-- Thesis at EPFL -->
<!-- Previously, I worked on my bachelor's thesis at [EPFL, Switzerland](https://www.epfl.ch/) under Prof. Johan Auwerx where I worked on analysing biological timeseries data with machine learning to investigate aging across mice populations.  -->
During my bachelor's thesis at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/) in Switzerland under Prof. Johan Auwerx, I used machine learning to analyze biological timeseries data and investigate aging across mice populations.


<!-- NMA TAs -->

<!-- I most recently parcipated at the [Neuromatch Academy](https://www.neuromatchacademy.org/), a summer school on computational neuroscience. I worked on various computational tools and their applications for real-world neuroscience problems. 
I also worked on the [Human Connectome Project (HCP)](https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/data-releases) dataset to analyze neural patterns in face and shape recognition in the human brain.

I previously worked at the [RWTH Aachen University](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/a/?lidx=1) as a research intern analyzing protein engineering techniques using machine learning tools. Specifically, I explored directed evolution, a method of selection based on natural evolution to filter specific biophysical properties of the proteins. -->
